This is a simple beautiful CLI application, a ToDo App.

The main file to execute is the "main.go" in CMD directory.

To add something to the Todo list use "-add" + whatever task.

To delete something in the Todo list use "-del=1" (whatever task you desire to delete).

To complete a task use "-complete=1" (whatever task you desire to complete).

To view the Todo list use "-list".

Of course you can also manually modify/edit the ".todos.json" file and remove/add any task.
